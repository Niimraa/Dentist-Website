# Dentist Website

## Description

This project is a non-functional dentist website designed based on principles of web design. The website represents a fictional dentist. The design choices are guided by heuristic analysis, specifically focusing on 10 general design principles.

## 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design

The website adheres to the following design principles:

1. **Visibility of System Status:** Clear indications of the system's status are provided to users.
2. **Match Between System and the Real World:** The design aligns with users' mental models for an intuitive experience.
3. **User Control and Freedom:** Users have autonomy in navigating the website without unintended consequences.
4. **Consistency and Standards:** The design follows established conventions.
5. **Error Prevention:** Measures are in place to minimize errors and create a smooth user journey.
6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** Information and options are presented to minimize the need for user recall.
7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:** The website accommodates various user skill levels, promoting efficiency.
8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:** A visually appealing and minimalist design focuses on essential information.
9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:** Clear guidance is provided in the event of errors.
10. **Help and Documentation:** Adequate resources are available to assist users in navigating the website effectively.

## Goals

The Dentist Website project aims to showcase the application of these design principles in creating a user-centered and visually pleasing experience for visitors. While the website is non-functional, its design serves as a valuable demonstration of user-centric principles and considerations in web development.
